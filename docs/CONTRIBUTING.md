## Style

4 spaces is used for indentation.

Braces for functions should be on the same line as the function declaration and touching the parentheses. An example of the coding style for functions is:

```
int example(void){
    return 0;
}
```

There should be a space in between the keyword and the first parentheses. Braces for if, while, for, etc. Should have a space in between the parentheses and the brace and the brace should be on the same line. An examples is:

```
if (var) {
    //do something
}
```
